# MedSymphony – AI-Powered Health Assistant

MedSymphony is a simple, accessible AI-powered health assistant website designed to help users quickly understand health symptoms and receive basic first-aid guidance.
It is built especially for rural users, elderly people, and users with low literacy, supporting both voice and text interaction in Telugu and English.

⚠️ MedSymphony does not replace doctors. It only provides first-level guidance and encourages users to seek professional medical help when needed.
